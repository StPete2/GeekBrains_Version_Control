## Notes

>[!NOTE]

>Information the user should notice even if skimming

Doesn't work. Although, there are some changes in layout... Will see the difference next.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Essential information required for user success.

## <>

\<script name> - that's cool. I haven't heard about it.

Why the colors are different?

> ">" sumbol is also used for citations...

## Formatting

This text is **bold** and we use ** for it on both sides of the text.

This text is *italic* and we use * for it on both sides of the text.

But this text is both ***bold and italic***. We have used *** for it.

## **Columns and rows**

: : : row : : :

    : : :column span="2": : :
    
    Text
    
    : : :column-end: : : 
    
    : : :column span =""
    
    Text 2

    : : :column-end: : : 
: : :row-end: : :

*Seems that columns and rows don't work, or I don't understand how they work...*

## Comments

*Comments* are used with **"<!---Text--->"**
<!---Here is my comment--->
<!---And I see absolutely nothing on the preview--->
<!---That's really cool--->

Please note that your comments can be read by everybody!

This is how we use it once again "<!---Comment --->" And... here is a new comment!

## Headings

Headings are simple. We use # for them. Like:
# Heading1
## Heading2
### Heading3
#### Heading4
##### Heading5
###### Heading6

**It is important to leave a space between # and a text.**

## Heading 2 second

I can navigate my document using headings! Cool!

## Images

![picture](unnamed-file-64.jpg)

**Fantastic!!! This is a real miracle!**

## Wonderful!

Once again I will write the syntax of this command: ![picture] and without a space (file.name)

:::image type="content" source="<folderPath>" alt-text="<alt text>":::

I guess, it needs some refreshing in my memory later.

:::image type="complex" source="<folderPath>" alt-text="<alt text>"::: <long description here> :::image-end:::

Above is a long image description

:::image type="icon" source="<folderPath>":::

*Above is an icon description*

<!---[!INCLUDE [<title>](<FileInclude1.md>)]--->

Something went wrong perhaps... with Include as it didn't work...

## Indentation

1. This is a number list example. The sentence is indented three spaces.

- this is a bulleted list example. It is indented two spaces.

>[!TIP] This tip is indented two spaces.

>This is a quote block.

1. This is 
1. a parent numbered list.
    1. and this is 
    1. a nested numbered list
1. **We don't need to write numbers, we can write only 1s.** The program will put the correct number automatically.

- This is
- a parent bulleted list
    - and this is 
    - a nested bulleted list
- all clear? :-)

Yes, Sir! Thank you, Sir!

1. is numbered list continued?
1. No, this is a new one.
    1. Thanks!

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * List item 1
> * List item 2
> * List item 3

doesn't work.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]

> [Click here to access FileInclude1.md](FileInclude1.md)

It works! Hurrah!

## Sub and Supscript

Hello! This is <sub>subscript</sub>. Fantastic!!!

Hello! This is <sup>superscript</sup>. Great!!!

## Tables

|This is    |a simple  |table header|
|-----------|----------|------------|
|table      | data     | here and there|
|it doesn't | have to line up| nicely!|

>Really so! Thanks! Now I see!

|Fun        |with       |Tables |
|:----------|----------:|:-------:|
|left-aligned column|right-aligned column|centered column|
|$100       |$100       |$100|
|$10        |$10        |$10|
|$1         |$1         |$1|

Another table example:

|           |Header 1   |Header 2|
|-----------|:-----------:|:--------:|
|__First column A__|Cell A1|Cell A2|
|__First column B__|Cell B1|Cell B2|


>[!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Universal Windows](Hello!.md)
> - [Windows Phone](unnamed-file-64.jpg)

It looks like a link... Interesting!

> [!div class="op_multipl_selector" title1="Platform" title2="Backend"]
> - [(iOS, Net)](Hello!.md)
> - [(Windows Universal C#)](unnamed-file-64.jpg)


Just the same.

## Conclusion

The homework job is done.

Thank you, Alexander!
