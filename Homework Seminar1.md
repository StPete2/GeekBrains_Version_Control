Doesn't work. Although, there are some changes in layout... Will see the difference next.

\<script name> - that's cool. I haven't heard about it.

Why the colors are different?

> ">" sumbol is also used for citations...

This text is **bold** and we use ** for it on both sides of the text.

This text is *italic* and we use * for it on both sides of the text.

But this text is both ***bold and italic***. We have used *** for it.

**Columns and rows**

: : :row: : :
    : : :column span="2": : :
    
    Text
    
    : : :column-end: : : 
    
    : : :column span =""
    
    Text 2

    : : :column-end: : : 
: : :row-end: : :

*Seems that columns and rows don't work, or I don't understand how they work...*

*Comments are used with "<!---Text--->"*
<!---Here is my comment--->
<!---And I see absolutely nothing on the preview--->
<!---That's really cool--->

Please note that your comments can be read by everybody!
