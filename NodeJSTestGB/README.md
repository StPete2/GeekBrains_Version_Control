## Hello!

My name is Aleksey and I'm a student of GeekBrains.ru frontend developer courses.

This is a test npm package. It aims at nothing but testing the process of creation and uploading a package to npm library.

This package sums up to numbers given as arguments.

### Method:

NodeJSTestGB.sum(num1, num2) // to add number2 to number1

### Usage:

NodeJSTestGB.sum(1, 2) // = 3

## Thank you!
