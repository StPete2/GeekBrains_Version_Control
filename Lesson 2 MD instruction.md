## Text formatting

To make text bold, use (**). For example: **bold**
To make text italic: use (*). For example: *italic*

Alternatevely, we can use (_) for italic, like: _italic_. 

And we can use (__) for bold text, like: __bold__. These are used for complex formatting, like:

Text _italic and italic, and **bold and italic**_.
